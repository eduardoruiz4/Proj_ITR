Introduction to ROS
Mini Project

During the course you have seen several ROS tools as well as learned how to create nodes, add publishers and subscribers, use actions, 
work with launch files, etc. Now you have to develop a project by your own using all this acknowledge.

Project main goal:

The ardrone should navigate completely autonomously, only manually activating the take-off and land instructions using the dynamic
reconfigure. 
Initially the ardrone will be landed on an augmented reality marker (marker 1), then, when take-off is activated, it should start
flying. While hovering, it should be aligned with the first marker detecting it with the bottom camera, once the alignment is done it
waits 5 seconds until the next step. Switching the camera (ROS service toggle camera) should allow you to detected marker 2. The 
quadrotor should fly towards the marker 2 and stop facing this at 1m. When the ardrone is hovering in front of the second marker, it
has to wait 5 seconds and then it has to land. 

If you feel confident with your proposed solution and the code, you can extend the project goal as much as you want.
